This is the SPA (front-end) part of my IssueTracker13557 application. Below are the steps for running the project. It has all functional CRUD operations. Angular needs to be installed if it is not already downloaded. `npm install -g @angular/cli` allows to install it. There is also an API repository the link to which is specified in the report.

## Before running the project

Run `npm i` to install all the node modules, then proceed to the next step.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically get reloaded if you change any of the source files.
